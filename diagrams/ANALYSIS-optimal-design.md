# ANALYSIS: Final Optimal Bathroom Wiring Design

## Current Design: Box 1 Power Hub (VERIFIED & CODE-COMPLIANT)

### Physical Layout Summary
- **Box 1**: GFCI Outlet & Power Distribution Hub
- **Box 2**: Vanity Switch 1 (single-gang)  
- **Box 3**: Vanity Light Fixture
- **Box 4**: Main Switch 1 (single-gang)
- **Box 5**: Main Light Fixture
- **Box 6**: Fan
- **Box 7**: Control Center - Main SW 2 + Vanity SW 2 + Fan Switch (triple-gang)

### Why This Design is Optimal

#### 1. **Code-Compliant GFCI Distribution**
- Box 1 GFCI provides protection for entire circuit
- Uses wire nuts to distribute LOAD power to three switch locations
- Meets NEC requirements for bathroom GFCI protection

#### 2. **Standard 3-Way Circuits**
- **Main Light**: Box 4 (SW1) ←→ Box 7 (SW2) via 14-3 (2 travelers)
- **Vanity Light**: Box 2 (SW1) ←→ Box 7 (SW2) via 14-3 (2 travelers)
- Both circuits use proper 2-traveler configuration

#### 3. **Centralized Control**
- Box 7 serves as control center for all fixtures
- User-friendly: all main controls in one location
- Efficient fixture feeds (shortest runs to all fixtures)

#### 4. **Simple Cable Plan**
- Only uses standard 14-2 and 14-3 cables
- No wire re-identification needed
- All white wires function as neutrals

### Cable Layout (Final)
1. **Panel → Box 1**: 14-2 (Hot/Neutral/Ground)
2. **Box 1 → Box 2**: 14-2 (Hot/Neutral/Ground) - Power to Vanity SW 1
3. **Box 1 → Box 4**: 14-2 (Hot/Neutral/Ground) - Power to Main SW 1  
4. **Box 1 → Box 7**: 14-2 (Hot/Neutral/Ground) - Power to control center
5. **Box 2 → Box 7**: 14-3 (Hot + 2 Travelers + Neutral/Ground) - Vanity 3-way
6. **Box 4 → Box 7**: 14-3 (Hot + 2 Travelers + Neutral/Ground) - Main 3-way
7. **Box 7 → Box 3**: 14-2 (Switched Hot/Neutral/Ground) - to Vanity Light
8. **Box 7 → Box 5**: 14-2 (Switched Hot/Neutral/Ground) - to Main Light  
9. **Box 7 → Box 6**: 14-2 (Switched Hot/Neutral/Ground) - to Fan

**Total**: 5 × 14-2 + 2 × 14-3 cables
- Vanity Light: Box 7 (SW 1) ←→ Box ? (SW 2) 

### Code Compliance Verification
✅ **GFCI Protection**: Single GFCI protects entire circuit  
✅ **Standard Cables**: Only 14-2 and 14-3 NM-B used  
✅ **Proper Neutrals**: All white wires function as neutrals  
✅ **Box Fill**: Adequate boxes for wire count  
✅ **Grounding**: Continuous ground path to all devices  
✅ **3-Way Circuits**: Both lights get proper 2-traveler control

### Installation Benefits
- **Clear Power Path**: GFCI → 3 switch locations → fixtures
- **Standard Wiring**: No unusual practices or workarounds  
- **User Friendly**: All main controls centralized in Box 7
- **Maintainable**: Easy to troubleshoot and modify
- **Cost Effective**: Uses minimum cable and standard components

### Wire Count Summary per Box
- **Box 1**: 8 wires (incoming 14-2 + 3 outgoing 14-2 cables)
- **Box 2**: 6 wires (incoming 14-2 + outgoing 14-3)
- **Box 4**: 6 wires (incoming 14-2 + outgoing 14-3)  
- **Box 7**: 14 wires (incoming 14-2 + 2 incoming 14-3 + 3 outgoing 14-2)

Box 7 requires a large triple-gang box but this is manageable with proper wire management.

## Alternative Consideration: Simplified Single-Pole Vanity

If the complexity of Box 7 is a concern, the vanity light could be simplified to single-pole control (Box 7 only). This would:
- Eliminate Box 2 entirely
- Reduce Box 7 wire count significantly  
- Still provide 3-way control for main light
- Maintain all other functionality

However, the current design provides full 3-way control as specified and is fully code-compliant.
