# 3-Way Switch Wiring Guide

## Understanding 3-Way Switches

3-way switches allow you to control a single light fixture from two different locations. This is essential for the main light and vanity light in your bathroom configuration.

## 3-Way Switch Terminal Identification

```
    3-Way Switch
   ┌─────────────┐
   │    COM      │ ← Common terminal (darker colored screw)
   │             │
   │  T1     T2  │ ← Traveler terminals (brass colored screws)
   │             │
   │   [GND]     │ ← Ground wire (pigtail or push-in connection)
   └─────────────┘
```

## Main Light 3-Way Wiring Configuration

### Switch Box 1 (Main Switch 1):
```
INCOMING POWER → 14-3 Cable to Switch 2 → 14-3 Cable to Light

Power Source (14-2):          To Switch 2 (14-3):         To Light (14-3):
- Hot (Black)    →  COM       - Traveler 1 (Red)   →  T1  - Switched Hot → COM
- Neutral (White) → Pigtail   - Traveler 2 (Black) →  T2  - Neutral     → Light
- Ground (Bare)   → Switch    - Ground (Bare)      →  GND - Ground      → GND
```

### Switch Box 2 (Main Switch 2):
```
From Switch 1 (14-3):         To Light Fixture (14-2):
- Traveler 1 (Red)   →  T1    - Switched Hot (Black) →  COM
- Traveler 2 (Black) →  T2    - Neutral (White)      →  Pigtail
- Ground (Bare)      →  GND   - Ground (Bare)        →  Switch
```

## Vanity Light 3-Way Wiring Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: The vanity light operates like a normal 3-way switched light - you can turn it ON/OFF from either switch location. Power flows from GFCI to Vanity Switch 1 first, then to the light fixture.

### Vanity Switch 1 (Receives Power from GFCI):
```
From GFCI (14-2 Cable):          To Vanity Light (14-2):     To Combined Box (14-3):
- Hot (Black)     →  COM         - Switched Hot → Light      - Hot Continuation  → Hot feed
- Neutral (White) →  Pass-through - Neutral      → Light      - Traveler 1 (Red)  → T1
- Ground (Bare)   →  Switch ground- Ground       → Light      - Traveler 2 (Black)→ T2
                                                              - Neutral (White)   → Pass-through
                                                              - Ground (Bare)     → Continue
```

### How Vanity Light Switching Works:
The vanity light uses **standard 3-way switch control** where:
1. **Hot wire**: From GFCI to Vanity Switch 1 COM terminal
2. **Switched hot**: From VS1 COM output to vanity light fixture
3. **Traveler control**: VS1 and VS2 coordinate through red/black travelers
4. **Light turns ON**: When both switches align to complete the circuit
5. **Light turns OFF**: When switches are in different positions

**Important**: This is normal 3-way switching - both switches control the same light.

### Combined Switch Box (Main Switch 1, Vanity Switch 2, Fan Switch):

#### Main Switch 1 (3-Way for Main Light):
```
Wire Connections in Combined Box:
- Hot (spliced from incoming) →  COM      - Traveler 1 (Red)   →  T1 (to Main Switch 2)
- Red (from Main Switch 2)    →  T1       - Traveler 2 (Black) →  T2 (to Main Switch 2)  
- Black (from Main Switch 2)  →  T2       - Switched Hot       →  COM (to main light)
- Ground (from ground bundle) →  Switch ground
```

#### Vanity Switch 2 (3-Way for Vanity Light):
```
Wire Connections in Combined Box:
- Hot (spliced from incoming) →  COM      - Hot (spliced)      →  COM (vanity control)
- Traveler 1 (Red)           →  T1        - Traveler 2 (Black) →  T2
- From Vanity Switch 1        →  T1,T2    - To vanity circuit   →  Controlled output
- Ground (from ground bundle) →  Switch ground
```

#### Fan Switch (Single Pole):
```
Wire Connections in Combined Box:
- Hot (spliced from incoming) →  LINE     - Switched Hot       →  LOAD (to fan)
- Ground (from ground bundle) →  Switch ground
```

**Key Point**: The vanity light turns ON/OFF normally from either switch. The 3-way switches control the **hot path** to complete the circuit.

## How Vanity Light 3-Way Switching Works

**Critical Understanding**: The vanity light operates like a normal 3-way switched light - it can be turned ON and OFF from either switch location.

### Power Flow Explanation:
```
1. GFCI provides HOT → Vanity Switch 1 COM terminal
                    ↓
2. VS1 COM output → Vanity Light Fixture (switched hot)
                    ↓
3. VS1 travelers → VS2 travelers (coordinate switching)
                    ↓
4. When VS1 & VS2 align → Complete circuit → Light ON
   When VS1 & VS2 differ → Broken circuit → Light OFF
                    ↓
5. Hot continuation → Combined switch box for other circuits
```

### What Each Wire Does:
- **Black from GFCI**: Provides hot to VS1 COM terminal  
- **Black to vanity light**: Switched hot output from VS1 COM
- **Red in 14-3 cable**: Traveler wire between VS1 and VS2 ONLY
- **Black in 14-3 cable**: Second traveler wire between VS1 and VS2 ONLY
- **White (neutral)**: Direct path from GFCI through switches to light
- **Ground**: Safety ground for all devices

### The Switching Logic:
- **Both switches same position**: Circuit complete → Vanity light ON
- **Switches different positions**: Circuit broken → Vanity light OFF
- **Either switch can control**: Normal 3-way operation

**Key Point**: The vanity light operates completely normally - you can turn it on and off from either switch location just like any other 3-way switched light.

## Wire Color Code Standards

### 14-2 Cable (contains one of each):
- **⚫ Black**: Hot (Line/Load)
- **⚪ White**: Neutral
- **🟢 Bare/Green**: Ground

### 14-3 Cable (contains one of each):
- **⚫ Black**: Hot or Traveler (used for hot lines and black traveler)
- **🔴 Red**: Traveler (only used between 3-way switches)
- **⚪ White**: Neutral (sometimes used as traveler when properly marked)
- **🟢 Bare/Green**: Ground

**Important**: All hot wires are black (⚫). Red (🔴) is only used for the red traveler wire in 3-way switch circuits.

## Detailed Fixture Installation Steps

### Vanity Light Installation:
```
Step-by-Step Connection:
1. Turn OFF power at breaker
2. Test with voltage tester
3. Identify fixture wires:
   - Black (or red) = Hot input
   - White = Neutral
   - Green/Bare = Ground
4. Connect in junction box:
   - Circuit black → Fixture black (wire nut)
   - Circuit white → Fixture white (wire nut)
   - Circuit ground → Fixture ground + box ground (wire nut)
5. Mount fixture to box
6. Install bulbs and test
```

### Main Light Installation:
```
Step-by-Step Connection:
1. Verify switched hot available at box
2. Connect fixture wires:
   - Switched hot (black) → Fixture hot (black)
   - Neutral (white) → Fixture neutral (white)  
   - Ground (bare) → Fixture ground (green/bare)
3. Ensure proper support for fixture weight
4. Test 3-way switch operation from both locations
```

### Exhaust Fan Installation:
```
Special Fan Wiring Considerations:
1. Fan receives power from control wire (not pass-through hot)
2. Connection sequence:
   - Control black from switch → Fan black
   - Circuit neutral (white) → Fan white
   - Circuit ground (bare) → Fan ground
3. Pass-through hot continues to switches (no fan connection)
4. Test fan operation from fan switch
```

### Junction Box Wire Management:

#### Proper Wire Nut Sizing:
- **Yellow wire nuts**: 2-3 wires (14 AWG)
- **Red wire nuts**: 3-4 wires (14 AWG)
- **Blue wire nuts**: 4-5 wires (14 AWG)

#### Wire Splicing Best Practices:
1. **Strip wires**: 3/4" of insulation
2. **Twist together**: Clockwise direction
3. **Apply wire nut**: Hand-tight plus 1/4 turn
4. **Tug test**: Gentle pull to verify connection
5. **Tape if needed**: Additional security for multiple wires

### Fixture-Specific Wiring Notes:

#### LED Fixtures:
- **Compatibility**: Verify with dimmer switches if used
- **Neutral required**: Always connect white wire
- **Grounding**: Essential for metal fixtures

#### Fan/Light Combinations:
- **Separate controls**: May require additional switching
- **Wire capacity**: Ensure box can handle extra connections
- **Load calculations**: Add both fan and light wattage

#### Moisture Considerations:
- **Bathroom rating**: All fixtures must be bathroom-rated
- **GFCI protection**: Required for all bathroom circuits
- **Proper sealing**: Use appropriate gaskets and mounting

## Critical Wiring Rules

### 1. Common Terminal Usage:
- **Power Side**: Hot wire connects to COM terminal
- **Load Side**: Switched hot to fixture connects to COM terminal

### 2. Traveler Wires:
- Always use the same terminals (T1 to T1, T2 to T2) between switches
- Traveler wires carry the switched signal between switches

### 3. Neutral Handling:
- Neutral wires pass through switch boxes but don't connect to switch terminals
- Use wire nuts to splice neutral connections
- Neutral must run continuously to light fixtures

### 4. Ground Connections:
- All switches, fixtures, and metal boxes must be grounded
- **Switch grounding methods**:
  - **Pigtail method**: Green wire from switch connects to ground wire bundle
  - **Push-in connection**: Ground wire pushes into back of switch
  - **Self-grounding**: Switch grounds through mounting screws (if box is grounded)
- Bond all grounds together in each box

## Testing 3-Way Switch Operation

### Proper Operation:
1. **Both switches in same position**: Light OFF
2. **Switches in different positions**: Light ON
3. **Either switch can turn light on/off**: Regardless of other switch position

### Troubleshooting Steps:
1. **Light doesn't work at all**:
   - Check power at first switch
   - Verify hot wire on COM terminal of power switch
   - Check switched hot wire on COM terminal of load switch

2. **Light works from one switch only**:
   - Check traveler wire connections
   - Ensure T1 connects to T1, T2 connects to T2
   - Verify continuity of traveler wires

3. **Light stays on constantly**:
   - Check for crossed wires
   - Verify neutral connections
   - Check for short circuits
