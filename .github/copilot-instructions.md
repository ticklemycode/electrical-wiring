This is a bathroom electrical wiring diagram documentation project. When working on this project:

## Context
- This project documents the electrical wiring for a bathroom with GFCI protection
- Includes main light with 3-way switches, vanity light with 3-way switches, and fan with single switch
- All wiring must comply with electrical codes and safety standards

## Code Style
- Use clear, descriptive ASCII art for wiring diagrams
- Follow electrical diagram conventions and symbols
- Include wire gauge specifications (typically 12 AWG for 20A circuits)
- Clearly distinguish between 2-wire and 3-wire configurations
- Use consistent formatting for electrical documentation

## Safety Considerations
- Always emphasize proper GFCI protection for bathroom circuits
- Include warnings about working with electrical systems
- Reference relevant electrical codes (NEC)
- Recommend professional electrician consultation

## Documentation Standards
- Provide step-by-step wiring instructions
- Include material lists with specifications
- Use standard electrical symbols and terminology
- Include troubleshooting guides
