```
Electrical Panel (15A Breaker)
    ↓ 14-2 Cable
    Hot: Black wire (120V)
    Neutral: White wire (0V reference)
    Ground: Bare wire (safety)
    ↓
Box 1 (GFCI Outlet)
    LINE Side: Receives panel power
    LOAD Side: Provides protected power
    ↓ 14-2 Cable  
    Hot: Black wire (120V GFCI-protected)

  - IN: Hot from panel
  - OUT: Protected hot to Box 2
- **Box 2 (Vanity Switch)**: 
  - IN: Protected hot from Box 1
  - OUT: Hot continues to Box 4
  - BRANCH: Hot to vanity 3-way switch COM
- **Box 4 (Main Switch)**: 
  - IN: Hot from Box 2
  - OUT: Hot continues to Box 7
  - BRANCH: Hot to main 3-way switch COM
- **Box 7 (Control Center)**:

## ⚪ Neutral Wire Flow (Always Continuous)

### **Neutral Path Through System**
```
Panel → Box 1 (GFCI) → Box 2 → Box 4 → Box 7
  0V      0V          0V     0V     0V
Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference
```

#### **Neutral Distribution to Fixtures**
- **Box 2**: Neutral branches to Box 3 (Vanity Light)
- **Box 4**: Neutral branches to Box 5 (Main Light)  
- **Box 7**: Neutral branches to Box 6 (Exhaust Fan)

**Key Point**: ✅ Neutrals flow continuously and are never switched

## � Critical: 3-Way Switching Implementation

### **How White Wires Carry Switched Hot**
In our linear design, the 3-way switches in Box 7 must return switched hot **back to the originating switch boxes** via the **WHITE wire in each 14-3 traveler cable**. This is because the lights are fed from Box 2 and Box 4, not directly from Box 7.

#### **Wire Re-identification Required**
- **Vanity Circuit**: White wire in Box 2↔Box 7 14-3 cable carries switched hot
- **Main Circuit**: White wire in Box 4↔Box 7 14-3 cable carries switched hot  
- **Safety**: Both white wires must be re-identified with BLACK tape at both ends
- **Code Compliance**: NEC 200.7(C) requires re-identification of white wires used as hot
